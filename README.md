# Zig URL Parser with Domain and TLD Support

## What's going on here?

This package is my first foray into Zig and is an ongoing project. It adds
domain and TLD parsing on top of the standard URI parser. The implementation
leverages the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to accurately
parse and identify the effective TLD and domains of URLs.

As I'm new to Zig, any feedback, suggestions, or contributions are greatly
appreciated!
